## Program overview

These course materials include from the [book](https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e) *Discovering Statistics Using IBM SPSS Statistics* with code examples using the `mtcars` dataset and the `penguins` dataset from the package [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). These course materials should not be used as an alternative to an actual course/book on these topics. There are great dedicated books to learning these topics using *R*, such as [Learning Statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/).
