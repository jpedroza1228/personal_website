abstract: Psychometrically sound parenting instruments are a critical aid in guiding
  clinical assessments of adolescent behavioral outcomes, particularly among clinical
  samples of adolescents. However, there is a paucity of research on these parenting
  instruments among adolescents with histories of substance use disorders (SUDs) who
  represent a high-risk clinical population for whom parents are critical in their
  recovery process. This study investigated the psychometric properties of an abridged
  17-item Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ) in a sample of 294 adolescents (45%
  female, mean age=16 years) and their parents (84% female) recruited from substance
  use treatment facilities as part of a longitudinal parent study. Confrmatory factor
  analyses established the factor ft of the abridged APQ, and path analyses assessed
  the predictive validity of the APQ constructs in relation to adolescent externalizing
  behaviour symptoms 6 months later. Results suggested the hypothesized three-factor
  model consisting of Positive Parenting, Poor Monitoring, and Inconsistent Discipline
  parenting constructs represented a satisfactory ft to the data, with minor modifcations
  in scale content for both adolescent and parent versions. All three latent factors
  were moderately correlated in the adolescent-reported version, but there was no
  evidence that Inconsistent Discipline and Poor Monitoring were signifcantly correlated
  in the parent-reported version. Additionally, results supported the predictive validity
  of these constructs related to adolescent externalizing behavioral outcomes. Overall,
  results of the present study support the utility of a multi-informant abridged parenting
  assessment. However, some items of the Parental Monitoring and Inconsistent Discipline
  constructs may not be strong indicators of parenting practices among youth in recovery
  from SUDs. We conclude with suggestions for future research eforts as well as clinical
  implications of parenting measures among adolescents with SUD histories.
